# Math-Visualization-and-Calculator

This project is a mathematical computation and visualization platform designed to demonstrate a practical understanding of core calculus and complex number concepts. The goal of this repository is not only to compute results, but to translate abstract mathematical theory into an interactive and usable software system.

The project covers fundamental topics typically taught in early university mathematics courses and implements them programmatically in a clean, modular, and extensible way.
